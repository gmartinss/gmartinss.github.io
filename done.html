        <p>When you look back at your life and, most importantly, yourself, what do you see? What do you feel? I feel at ease.</p>
        <p>Surely not everything is perfect, as nothing in our realm ever is, but it's definitely clear that to me the passage of time means evolution and not simply ageing, and that I have been able to offer the world a better person.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">What's the secret?</span> There isn't any. How can it be a secret if there are so many people talking about it? Surely each in his or her own way, but everyone of them is essentially saying the same thing: set your goals, be disciplined, learn and iterate. That's what I have been doing, but what happened before is how I got to intimately know this process.</p>
        <p>Up until I was 9, you probably wouldn't say I was decisevely different from the other kids of my age except for my good grades and behavior. But then, life happened and I became an employee. I'm not kidding you. I started working at age 9! My parents moved, and my father decided to chase his dream of working with tennis, so for the next 9 years I was a full time employeed who often worked way over 8 hours a day, and who still performed really well at school.</p>

        <p>I do say that with pride because, as plenty of people can attest, work plus school is a difficult combination to handle, and don't forget that I also needed to find time to be a kid or teenager! In the meantime I learned a few priceless points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One must always evaluate what's going on.</li>
          <li>One must always set priorities and respect them.</li>
          <li>One must always strive to be in a better position.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are probably getting the feeling that my life was busy, and I tell you, your sixth sense is accurate! But really what I believe you need to know about me is that in the other end of my own Schr√∂dinger's experiment I came out <span class="highlight">a very capable person!</span>  
        </p>
        <p>I continued to put that to the test when I moved to the US to go to college. I was a student athlete, which pretty much just means that beside broke I also was very busy and hungry... and working a lot to make ends meet. Four years later, I graduated with a 3.4GPA (4.0 is the maximum) and moved on to graduate school to obtain my masters in business administration degree. Two years later, I finished this endeavour and moved to the Caribbean, and that's, perhaps, where I experienced life the most: I was completely outside of my comfort zone, but [very] fortunate to have found people who supported me like I was family, and these priceless lessons were vital when I moved back to Brazil and had to battle country's unique hurdles.</p>
        <p>I managed it, albeit not unscathed, and I joined the oil & gas business from which I'm currently transitioning. I'm bringing with me the good skills that management of multi million dollar projects taught me, and the tough skin that daily 12-hour shifts of 6 week rotations gave me.</p>
        <p>I'm doing what I love: learning, putting it into practice, iterating. It will be no different from before. <span class="highlight">I will succeed!</span></p>
